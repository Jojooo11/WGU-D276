# **WGU-D276 Objective Assesment Guide**

## This repo aims to help WGU students in completing their D276 PA (Performance Assessment). 

> [!WARNING]
> This is not a resource for cheating. Its intention is to aid any WGU students in D276.

> [!WARNING]
> I am not liable or personally responsible if you happen to receive a bad grade. You are highly encouraged to use this as a resource, not as a single source of truth.

> [!NOTE]
> Please read the comments within the code as they serve as helpers for understanding or knowing where to add certain things or why my code is the way it is. 


I would love for independent contributors to help refine this as well. Please let me know if you are interested.
